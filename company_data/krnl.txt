The Future Vision: A Unified Multi-Chain
Ecosystem
In a scenario where KRNL technology is deployed across all blockchains, the Web3 community
would benefit from a unified, efficient, and interconnected ecosystem. Blockchains could
leverage each otherʼs strengths, optimizing tasks across the network and reducing the
fragmentation that currently plagues the space. This would lead to:
● Maximized Efficiency and Specialization: Leveraging the unique strengths of different
blockchains to perform specific tasks, reducing redundancy and enhancing overall
ecosystem performance.
● Resource Optimization and Cost Reduction: Enabling blockchains to offload tasks to the
most cost-effective and resource-efficient networks, significantly lowering transaction
fees and energy consumption.
● Accelerated Innovation and Ecosystem Growth: Lowering development barriers and
fostering rapid innovation, resulting in a more vibrant ecosystem of decentralized
applications.
● Unified User Experience and Reduced Fragmentation: Providing a seamless experience
for users, who can interact with dApps across multiple chains without the complexities
of managing multiple wallets and tokens.
KRNL is not just solving isolated issues within the blockchain space—it is redefining the very
infrastructure of decentralized computing. By creating a new standard for cross-chain
interactions and scalable execution, KRNL positions itself as a category-defining project with
the potential to become the backbone of a unified multi-chain ecosystem. This transformative
approach presents a compelling investment opportunity, paving the way for the next generation
of Web3 applications and services.

High Level Architecture
A high-level diagram describing the architecture of all the components that make up the KRNL
ecosystem are given in Figure 1 with a description of each.

KRNL Platform
The KRNL Platform is the component of the architecture that serves as an extension interface
for KRNL providers and developers to register features, enabling other KRNL users to
orchestrate complex multichain and off-chain activities through a unified query API.
There are three actors that utilize the KRNL platform. These actors are:
● Kernel Provider
● dApp Developer
● Smart Contract Developer
The platformʼs user interface is implemented as a dApp that uses upgradeable smart contracts
to accomplish its functionality. These include managing the on-chain KRNL registry and
schemas within IPFS. In Figure 2 there are examples of the data structures that are used by the
system.

Kernel Provider
This actor is a person who will use the KRNL platform to register and expose their on/off-chain
functions (kernels) to the KRNL ecosystem as shown in Figure 3.
Flow:
The Kernel Providers enter all the technical details that are needed by the KRNL Node (modified
Geth Client) to be able to communicate with the on/off-chain functions/services, including the
fee and a collateral stake to reassure users of their integrity.

Smart Contract Developer
This actor is a person who has designed a smart contract but now wishes to upgrade it to
include KRNL functionality. These upgraded smart contracts are referred to as “Registered
Smart Contractsˮ within the KRNL ecosystem. A screenshot of the user interface is shown in
Figure 4.
Flow:
The Smart Contract Developers register their smart contracts with the KRNL platform (see
image below) and define all the kernels (execution plan) that need to be enforced as part of
their protocol.

They also need to upgrade their smart contracts by following the specification given by the
KRNL protocol as shown in Figure 5 and deploy a Token Authority (TA) that will be used to
provide the cryptographic security and ultimately the Signature Token (digital signature) with
other parameters that will be embedded in the smart contract call as a parameter before it is
signed by the dApp user and transmitted into the blockchain.
The Signature Token (ST) is used to prove the provenance of the transactions that arrive at the
registered smart contracts interface and confirm the correctness of the response/result
returned by the kernels.

dApp Developer
This actor is a person who can use the KRNL platform to connect their dApp with the registered
smart contract in order to see the execution plan and kernels that will be executed by the
protocol as shown in Figure 6.

Flow:
The dApp Developer can select the registered smart contract they would like to transact with to
retrieve a unique identifier (Entry ID) and an Access Token (AT - shown in Figure 7) that is
required to communicate with the KRNL Node and conversely the associated TA that they need
to set up. These credentials are used to configure the KRNL SDK with the dApp.

Figure 8 provides a sequence diagram of the journey and processes for each actor.

KRNL Node & Token Authority (TA)
The KRNL Node and TA work together to authenticate the execution of the kernels, manage the
execution plan (sequence and order of kernels) and check the KRNL Node is legitimate by
using Runtime Integrity Scanning and private/public key pairs (whitelist) to ensure complete
integrity of the process.
KRNL also leverages the existing technology that is already built and tested such as the RPC
server and GraphQL runtime engine by utilizing custom resolvers to offer Account Abstraction,
native blockchain read/view (stateless) and Web2 (Open API specification compliance)
resolvers to execute functions on other optimized environments.
Runtime Integrity Scanning
Implementing runtime integrity checks within the application itself can help detect
modifications. This involves periodically scanning the memory and code sections to ensure
they havenʼt been tampered with.
The KRNL Node calculates the SHA256 hash of the executable file at runtime and passes this
to the TA for comparison with a precomputed hash to detect modifications.
KRNL Node Private/Public Keys
The TA can be configured to hold a list of public keys that represent specific KRNL Nodes that
it considers to be legitimate to strengthen their relationship and add another layer of security.

KRNL Software Development Kit (SDK)
The KRNL SDK (krnl.js) implements several functions. This includes a “Get Kernel Costˮ and
“Execute Kernelsˮ as shown in the sequence diagrams in Figure 9 and 10.

When a kernel is registered, the Kernel Provider will set a price for the execution of that kernel.
The “Get Kernel Costˮ function will look up the cost of each kernel from the decentralized
registry, do the relevant conversion using UNISWAP and return a total cost so the dApp user
can confirm their acceptance of the cost before execution is started.
The “Execute Kernelsˮ function is the core component of the KRNL technology. Once the
function is called using the KRNL SDK with the appropriate parameters, the KRNL Compute
Engine in the KRNL Node will communicate with the TA to manage the execution plan of the
kernels by using the GraphQL runtime and the relevant resolvers as show in the sequence
diagram in Figure 11.

The purpose of the TA is to control the execution of each kernel, the correctness of the results
and once the execution plan is successful, it will issue a Signature Token ST with an opinion
that will be returned to the KRNL SDK with the relevant responses, results, and proofs from the
kernels.
The KRNL SDK will use the returned Signature Token, including the opinion from the TA with
the responses, results, proofs as input parameters to the actual smart contract transaction
before signing it with the userʼs approval using the crypto wallet then transmitting it to the
blockchain. Once the EVM executes the registered smart contract, the code within the
registered smart contract can verify the Signature Token (its authenticity) and use the
responses, results, and proofs accordingly.

Security Model
The KRNL protocol uses cryptography (digital signatures) as its primary mechanism to secure
each component of the system, the communication between them and implement the Proof of
Provenance PoP technology to maintain a trustless environment.
The TA is central to the system's integrity, it maintains the same ownership as the registered
smart contract(s) and acts as a controller agent with any KRNL Node(s) that communicate with
it.
The TA has many layers of security, these include:
Security components:
● Entry ID:
○ A unique identifier that is obtained from the TA by a dApp builder.
● Access Token:
○ A signed signature of the Entry ID. This is used as a token-based authentication
mechanism that is used to verify the origin signerʼs key.
● Node runtime digest whitelisting:
○ A SHA-256 hash of the run-time binary of the KRNL node that the TA can trust,
ensuring the authenticity of KRNL nodeʼs binary code.
● Node key whitelisting:
○ A KRNL node can be configured with a signer private key. By embedding the
public key of this pair within the TAʼs whitelist, only legitimate nodes can
communicate with the TA.
Communication:
● Execution plan:
○ The TA contains the logic to manage the execution plan. There is an “Opinion
Makerˮ that validates the results and proofs of each kernelʼs execution on each
communication call, making the decision for the KRNL Compute Engine to
continue to the next kernel or stop execution. It also provides the final
Signature Token (ST) if the execution plan was successful. The code and logic
of the TA is in the full control of the registered smart contract developer.
● Handshake/Ping-pong mechanism:
○ TA will verify all security components above on each call from the KRNL
Compute Engine to ensure the KRNL has not been compromised.
● Proof of authenticity:
○ Signature token issued by the TA ensures the authenticity of all parameters for
registered smart contract function, kernelʼs execution, result and proof of
kernel. This guarantees the smart contract is receiving all legitimate data when
using KRNL protocol.

progress but has all the details required to understand the components and how they interact
with each other including their interfaces.

Modular Design of Geth and KRNL
Geth is built with a modular architecture, where different components (e.g., consensus,
networking, storage) are separated into distinct packages. This separation allows new
functionality to be added or existing functionality to be replaced by custom modules. For
example, the eth package handles Ethereum protocol logic, while the p2p package manages
peer-to-peer networking.
KRNL Geth, the forked version of Geth, has been customized to implement a plugin architecture
that allows for seamless extension and modification of its behavior without altering the
underlying consensus mechanism. This design choice enables KRNL Geth to maintain
compatibility with new releases of Geth without requiring changes to its core code. If a
transaction is processed normally through standard Geth, KRNL Geth can still operate correctly
and simply pass the transaction along as if nothing had happened. However, when a kernel
enhanced transaction triggers custom logic at the pre-mempool stage, additional executions
either on/off-chain are possible before deciding whether to push the transaction into the
mempool. Rebuilding and re-loading this plugin into an updated KRNL Geth instance maintains
separation between custom code and underlying blockchain functionality, ensuring smooth
integration of new releases while preserving the integrity of custom logic.
Plugin Interface
The Geth client exposes specific plugin interfaces that developers can implement to introduce
new functionalities. Plugins are typically Go packages that implement certain interfaces defined
by the core Geth codebase. These interfaces provide methods for initializing, starting,
stopping, and managing the lifecycle of plugins.

Plugin Registration
Plugins are registered with the Geth client during startup. When Geth is initialized, it loads all
registered plugins (can be selective), initializes them, and makes them available for use
throughout the nodeʼs lifecycle. This registration is usually done via a init() function within the
plugin package, which is called by the Go runtime when the package is imported.
Event Hooks and Middleware
Plugins can leverage event hooks and middleware provided by Geth to intercept or modify the
behavior of certain operations. For example:
● Transaction Pool Hooks: Plugins can hook into the transaction pool to inspect, modify,
or reject transactions before they are added to the mempool.
● Consensus Hooks: Plugins can interact with the consensus mechanism to add custom
validation rules or modify block production logic.
● Networking Hooks: Plugins can modify or extend networking protocols, enabling
custom peer discovery or communication methods.
● RPC Middleware: Plugins can add custom Remote Procedure Call (RPC) methods or
middleware to handle custom requests or modify responses.
Interacting with Core Components
A plugin can interact with core Geth components through APIs and internal packages. For
example, a plugin might interact with the transaction pool by importing the relevant packages
and using their exposed functions or data structures. This interaction allows the plugin to
extend or modify the behavior of the core components without directly altering the Geth source
code.
Configuration and Initialization
During the startup, Geth reads its configuration files and command-line parameters to
determine which plugins to load and how to configure them. Each plugin can define its own
configuration parameters, which are parsed and handled by the plugin itself. This configuration
can include settings such as enabling or disabling the plugin, setting custom parameters, or
defining integration points with other systems.

Geth Security
The Geth (Go Ethereum) client has several built-in features and mechanisms to protect it from
bad actors and malicious behavior within the Ethereum network. These protections are
designed to prevent malicious activities such as spamming, DDoS attacks, double-spending,
and other types of network abuse.
The KRNL node leverages all of these features especially the following:
● Inbound Connection Limits
● RPC Rate Limiting
● Efficient Memory and Resource Management
● Advanced Networking Stack
Release Integrity Verification Process
To maintain the integrity and consistency of our software releases, we will use SHA256
cryptographic hashes as a verification mechanism. This process helps ensure that the files you
download are authentic and have not been tampered with or corrupted.
Hash Generation: For every official release, we generate a SHA256 hash for each file. These
hashes uniquely represent the exact contents of the files at the time of release.
Hash Publication: We publish the SHA256 hashes in a file named `SHA256SUMS.txt` alongside
the release files on our website. This file is made publicly available so users can easily access
it.
User Verification: We provide clear instructions to users on how to verify the downloaded files
against the published SHA256 hashes. Users can run a simple command or use automated
tools to compare the hash of their downloaded file with the official hash from our
`SHA256SUMS.txt` file. A match confirms the file's authenticity and integrity.
Security Measures: We securely host the `SHA256SUMS.txt` file and digitally sign it using a
GPG key. This additional security measure ensures that users can verify both the integrity of
the files and the authenticity of the hash file itself.
Continuous Monitoring: We continuously monitor the distribution channels to ensure that the
files and their corresponding hash values remain unchanged and consistent with our official
releases.

Compliance and Testing
To ensure the KRNL custom module for the Geth client is compliant with the Ethereum network,
several types of tests are conducted. These tests ensure that the custom modifications or
extensions do not break core Ethereum functionalities, adhere to Ethereum's protocol
specifications, and maintain compatibility with other nodes in the network. Here is a
comprehensive list of tests that we run:

actions and transactions.
User Acceptance Testing UAT
Purpose: To ensure that the custom module meets the intended requirements and works
correctly from a user perspective.

Running a KRNL Node
The KRNL Node is basically a Geth full node with custom plugins, therefore its hardware
requirements may need to change based on the level of activity it undertakes.
KRNLʼs plugin introduces new functionality, processes, and resource-intensive operations that
could impact the nodeʼs overall performance but the minimum specification for a Geth Full
Node should be enough to operate a KRNL Node at the outset.
As part of the development of the KRNL Node we are undertaking the following actions:
Benchmark and Profiling of the KRNL Node
● Conducting performance benchmarking and profiling to understand the pluginʼs impact
on CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
● Tools: Using tools like pprof (Goʼs performance profiling tool), htop, iostat, dstat, and
nload to measure resource utilization.
● Set up a controlled test environment and run the Geth node with the custom plugin
under various scenarios (e.g., high transaction load, different types of transactions,
syncing with the network).
● Monitor and record CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage to identify potential
bottlenecks.
Optimize the Plugin Code
● Optimize the custom plugin to reduce its resource footprint.
● Techniques:
○ Algorithmic Optimization: Improve the efficiency of the algorithms used within
the plugin (e.g., use more efficient data structures, avoid redundant
computations).
○ Memory Management: Use more efficient memory handling techniques, such as
memory pooling or garbage collection optimization, to reduce memory usage.
○ Disk I/O Optimization: Minimize disk writes and reads by using caching,
batching, or compression.
○ Concurrency: Use Goʼs concurrency model (goroutines, channels) to parallelize
tasks and make better use of CPU resources.
○ Lazy Loading: Load data or perform operations only when necessary to reduce
startup times and memory usage.
Implement Resource Limiting and Monitoring
● Implement resource limits and monitoring to prevent the custom plugin from consuming
excessive resources.
● Techniques:
○ Resource Capping: Use resource limits (e.g., cgroups on Linux) to restrict the
CPU, memory, or I/O usage of the Geth process or the custom plugin.
○ Monitoring Tools: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or custom
scripts to track resource usage and set up alerts for unusual behavior.
○ Fail-Safes: Implement fail-safes within the plugin to gracefully handle situations
where resource limits are reached.

Summary
By leveraging KRNL's open framework and modular stack, developers gain access to a
two-sided marketplace where they can both build and monetize innovative, multi-modal
composable functions across not just Ethereum and Web3 multichain but also all of Web2
datasources. At the same time, dApp Developers can access best-in-class kernels to meet
their specific needs, unlocking new levels of efficiency, responsiveness, and reach. KRNL's
robust security infrastructure ensures that these operations are conducted within a fortified
environment, safeguarding against vulnerabilities and enhancing trustworthiness in Web3
activities. Ultimately, KRNL empowers developers to create more advanced, secure, and
scalable smart contract solutions, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in decentralized
applications.
